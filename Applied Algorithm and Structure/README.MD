# Applied Algorithm and Structure

From this class, I learn some basic concepts such as Correctness of algorithms, running time, etc. and different type of algorithms such as:

1. **[Longest Common Subsequence](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/blob/master/Applied%20Algorithm%20and%20Structure/Dynamic%20Programming/LCS.java)**  
Implement the bottom-up algorithm for finding the longest common subsequence of two strings. The program should contain a method that takes two strings and returns the length of their LCS. Following is the picture of Longest Common Subsequence table:

2. **[Float Compare](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/blob/master/Computer%20System%20I/%232%20bitwise%2BIEEE%2Bpointer.c)**  
Integer and bitwise operations, The IEEE floating point format. See [Instruction](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/blob/master/Computer%20System%20I/Assignments%20instructions/%232%20Instruction.pdf).
3. **[Assembly Language](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/blob/master/Computer%20System%20I/%233%20understanding%20assembly%20language.pdf)**  
Basics of assembly language, The layout of an activation record.
4. **[Bomb Lab](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/blob/master/Computer%20System%20I/%234%20bomblab.pdf)**  
See [Unsolved Bomb](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/blob/master/Computer%20System%20I/Assignments%20instructions/codes%20for%20bomblab.txt).
