# Computer System II

Extension of [Computer System I](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/tree/master/Computer%20System%20I). Focus on compiler, thread, proess and signal. Overall, it's a challenging course compare to previous one but definitely worth it.

1. **[Compiler Optimization](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/tree/master/Computer%20System%20II/Compiler%20Optimization)**  
Concepts of compiler Optimization and some practices about linking header file and object file layout. See [Instruction](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/blob/master/Computer%20System%20II/Assignment%20Instructions/%231%20instructions.pdf).
2. **[Creating Processes and Signal Handling](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/tree/master/Computer%20System%20II/Creating%20Processes%20and%20Signal%20Handling)**  
Practice creating processes and signal handling. See [Instruction](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/blob/master/Computer%20System%20II/Assignment%20Instructions/%232%20instructions.pdf).

3. **[Using Thread and Safe C Memory Programming](https://github.com/edwardlin0524/Grad-Courseworks/tree/master/Computer%20System%20II/Using%20Thread%20and%20Practicing%20Safe%20C%20Memory%20Programming)**
